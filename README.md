# Firestore Data Visualiser

The website For HacktoberFest Is Live At [chepobin-public.herokuapp.com](https://chepobin-public.herokuapp.com).

This project Uses [Ejs](https://ejs.co/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).


# Goal

This project is a template for projects with opensource or public code and they are using firestore. You can make a seperate database for the test app and give all contributors visual acess as they would have on the firestore website. Place the firebase service admin creds in the env and deploy on heroku. You need to add the env vars in the heroku app settings too.
